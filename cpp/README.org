* OSX
** building gtest/gmock 

Use 

#+begin_src shell
cmake .
#+end_src

inside the google-mock directory. The linker should pick the resulting libs up.


** Building MonkVG

 - create link in include dir from MonkVG to VG 
 - adapt project settings to install after build


** Building ShivaVG

 - run 

#begin_src shell
  $ autoreconf --install
  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/ShivaVG
  $ make
  $ make install
#end_src

This will create errors because the path /opt/ShivaVG/include/GL
doesn't exist. Copy over src/GL into the include directory.
