** Building MonkVG

 - create link in include dir from MonkVG to VG 
 - adapt project settings to install after build


** ShivaVG

*** Version

http://github.com/ileben/ShivaVG.git 6122ccb3c4b86f69a326f1a65b0f86bc79f69c50

*** Requirements

With brew installed:

 - autoconf
 - automake
 - libjpeg
 - libtool

*** Building


#begin_src shell
  $ autoreconf --install # possibly several times??!
  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/ShivaVG
  $ make
  $ make install
#end_src

This will create errors because the path /opt/ShivaVG/include/GL
doesn't exist. Copy over src/GL into the include directory.
