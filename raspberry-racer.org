** TODO check right-turn curves

 - [ ] check nearest_point() works
 - [ ] check rendering

** TODO check ways of integrating b2CurveJoint into Box2D 

Currently, we need a friend-declaration in b2Body.h. That sucks.
** TODO deletion of world-objects

for know I think that should happen when the world has ended.


I should move to shared_ptr

It currently goes to 360

* OSX
** Requirements

brew install of 

 - libpng
 - png++
 - boost

** gyp

Use from within the working-copy, setup.py is broken

*** Version

http://gyp.googlecode.com/svn 

Last Changed Rev: 1682


** gtest/gmock 

*** running

Run

#begin_src shell
(working-copy) $ out/Default/test
#end_src

To run specific tests, use

#begin_src shell
(working-copy) $ out/Default/test --gtest_filter=OpenVGCompanionTests.TestImageDrawing 
#end_src

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12076072/how-to-run-specific-test-cases-in-googletest

*** building
Use 

#+begin_src shell
cmake .
#+end_src

inside the google-mock directory. The linker should pick the resulting libs up.


** Building MonkVG

 - create link in include dir from MonkVG to VG 
 - adapt project settings to install after build

** ShivaVG

*** Version

http://github.com/ileben/ShivaVG.git 6122ccb3c4b86f69a326f1a65b0f86bc79f69c50

*** Requirements

With brew installed:

 - autoconf
 - automake
 - libjpeg
 - libtool

*** Building


#begin_src shell
  $ autoreconf --install # possibly several times??!
  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/ShivaVG
  $ make
  $ make install
#end_src

This will create errors because the path /opt/ShivaVG/include/GL
doesn't exist. Copy over src/GL into the include directory.
